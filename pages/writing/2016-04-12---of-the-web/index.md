I’ve been _on_ the web for most of my life, but, without a site to call home, I haven’t been [_of_ the web](https://adactio.com/journal/9016) for far too long.

I’m thrilled to change that with the launch of this site. I didn’t build it for only me, though. One of my favorite things about building on the web is how freely knowledge and tools are shared. I wanted to contribute to that. So, to that end:

1. While I didn’t hesitate to [learn and employ many new tools](/colophon/), I did so with an eye toward maintaining the utility of View Source. I learned almost everything I know about HTML &amp; CSS from viewing the source of sites I found inspiring, beautiful, and clever. I hope that this site’s code can help someone in the same way. The full source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/kylegach/kylegach_com).

2. I plan to write about design challenges I’ve faced and other things I’ve learned. At first, this will likely focus on the process of building this site, but I’m excited to see where I’m led to write from there.

3. I <del>have</del> <ins>will</ins> put considerable effort into making this site as accessible and fast as possible. It is my hope that this, along with some explanatory posts/guides, can serve as an example for the way I believe the web should be: fully accessible, lightning fast, and responsive.

Thanks for reading!
